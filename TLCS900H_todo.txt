TLCS900H To do
--------------

	Optimise DAA.
	B/W/L tables for reg opcodes.
	Better loading/saving of register state
	Implement division in ARM asm instead of relying on GBA/NDS SWI functions.
	Move memory area 0x00-0xFF from io.s to cpu core.

	Sort interrupts according to priority before executing them?
	SLL should insert 1 into bit#0 like on Z80?
	PUSH and POP are used from BIOS and interrupts!!!
